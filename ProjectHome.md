A development extension to Firebug for working with Closure Library and Closure Compiler.

Closure Inspector knows how the obfuscated JavaScript corresponds to your original source code. This makes it easier to debug code output by Closure Compiler.

**Closure Inspector is currently deprecated.** Closure Inspector was a prototype to demonstrate how we could use source correspondence maps to debug generated code in the browser. Currently, we are working with browser makers to get this functionality in the browser.
